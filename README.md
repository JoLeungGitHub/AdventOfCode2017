My solutions to http://adventofcode.com/ 2017.

Solutions are ment to be as quick as possible, not the best.

I just write out the first thing that comes to mind that I think will work.

**Advent of Code** is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.
